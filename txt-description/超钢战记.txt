II.  FEATURES
===========================================================================

DAMAGE GAUGE
------------

The vertical bar in both sides of the screen. It is initially empty.
Fill the opponent's Damage Gauge by attacking. When your Damage Gauge
is full, you lose the round. A game is two out of three rounds, though
the Damage Gauge of the winner is carried over to the next round, so
rounds can be really short !!
The time counter is not restored to max, either. It is added a small
amount of time after every round, so sometimes the loser of the first
round must be very offensive to win the second one.

RECOVERABLE LIFE
----------------

Most attacks cause two kinds of damage: a clean damage, displayed as a
red bar in your damage gauge, and a repairable damage, displayed as a
yellow bar in the same gauge.

You can do nothing about the clean damage, but if you manage to stay a
few seconds without being attacked, the yellow bar will drop slowly to
zero. However, if you get hit again and again to the point your red and
yellow bars fill the gauge, your repairable damage will become permanent
damage (yellow bar will torn red) losing the round. This may cause the
feeling of taking huge damage from the last hit. Don't get confused by
this!

So, it's a good thing to watch the yellow bar and to take a breathe when
things are too hot!

ARMOR
-----

Next to your damage gauge, there's a yellow circle containing a human
figure and a percentage. This is your current armor status. Blocking
too much will cause this gauge to decrease quickly. When it drops to
zero, your armor is destroyed and your mech will fly away because of
the impact, being this last thing a possible advantage depending on
the situation (you may avoid further damage)

Armor reduces the effect of enemy fire taking less damage from attacks.
I'm not sure if some mechs have better armors than others. The game
seems to mean that, as in certain characters profile appear things
like "strong armor" and "ultra defensive armor". In my experience,
heavy mechs armor seems to last longer, but this also may be due to
my highly offensive style using these characters.

SPECIAL ATTACK
--------------

Your typical super move. You can store up to three units, starting the
battle with one in stock.
Special attacks do clean damage (no recoverable life)

OBSTACLES
---------

Yes, all these little houses, factories and other constructions are
not there only for ornament. They are active part of the game!
Depending on the stage, you can find a variable number of obstacles
scattered in the surroundings. All the obstacles are destroyable,
the little ones by stepping on them and the larger ones by firing
a few shots. Move behind a large obstacle for a short cover.

ITEMS
-----

Move across the stage and step on the various obstacles. Some of them
release items of different kinds when destroyed. Large obstacles release
more powerful items. Also, hitting hard your opponents usually cause
them to drop some of their items, all of which you can recover.

You collect an item simply by walking over it, being possible to store
up to five units. Your items are shown on top of the damage gauge.

To change the selected item, press START.
To activate the selected item, press A+B+J

There are 3 types of items:

RECOVERING TYPE: usually released by large obstacles. So far, I have
identified
  * Armor recover :  restores your armor gauge to 100%
  * Life recover  :  you regain some life, or to be exact, your damage
		     gauge decreases a certain quantity.
  * Special charge:  adds one level to your Special gauge.

ABILITY TYPE: they give your character special powers, such as
  * Offense up :  increase the damage of your attacks
  * Defense up :  you take less damage from enemy attacks
  * Speed up   :  you move and perform attacks faster
  * Hero mode  :  weapon systems enhanced

WEAPON TYPE: this will give you a weapon specific to your character
(it varies from one mech to other). Every character has his own
inventory of 3 different weapon items.

When a mech drops a weapon item and it is recovered by the facing mech,
the weapon is reconverted to this last's inventory. Ability items are
unaffected.

Once you have activated an item, a short bar is displayed over your
item inventory. This is a time meter. When the bar drops to zero,
the item has been consumed and you can no longer use it, unless you
activate another one!

WARNING MOVES
-------------

During the execution of certain moves, a "warning" message appears
pointing to your character. These moves are exceptionally slow, yet
forceful enough to cause a blocking opponent to stagger momentarily
even when blocking. A quick attack launched during the stagger will
connect successfully.
You will find these moves labeled with a 'W' in the movelist.

POWER BREAKER
-------------

This move will crush your opponent's guard, leaving him vulnerable for
a short time. Great for turtlers.
When near opponent, press simultaneously A+B+G.

GRAPPLE ATTACK
--------------

A feature already used in other games, such as Soul Edge and Samurai
Showdown, but unusual in a Capcom game. Basically, is the same concept:
When two attacks collide, the Grapple Attack begins. Both mechs push
against each other trying to win the assault. Mash those buttons!
The loser gets stunned, though it's possible the draw. In that case,
both mechs are pushed back.

COUNTERSTRIKE
-------------

A very useful move if you know how to play with it, since it allows you to
avoid enemy fire and at the same time to attack an opponent in vulnerable
position.

Every mech has two counterstrikes, activated by pressing either
G+A or G+B.

Your character will sidestep\round the enemy, performing the attack
corresponding to each variant.

STEEL DASH
----------

An easy but risky way to close the distance and strike by surprise!

Hold G button, then ->->

Your character will dash forward enveloped in an energy aura.
Enemy fire cannot stop you, but you still take damage.

FINAL ATTACK
------------

The Ultimate Destruction Attack !!  You can't escape !!
When "FINAL ATTACK" appears on the screen

press simultaneously A+B+J+G

If it connects, it takes the entire Damage Gauge and the round.
Only once per match !  (Blockable)

FINAL ATTACK: The Little House

The curtain drops.
The curtain rises, we can see Bolon and his opponent inside a little nice
house, having tea or something similar. The opp seems to commit a foolish
act of descourtesy such as putting the feet over the table and then Bolon,
enraged, smashes the table into opponent's face, who flies away breaking
the roof and droping outside the house.

			As you can imagine, it stuns.
L. Express              A very curious one. Bolon throws one of his many
			body parts, a train. The convoy moves quickly
			around the opponent, running between his legs,
			hindering him and causing damage.

HERO MODE:

Bolon summons a hodgepodge of floating objects which join in any attacks.
